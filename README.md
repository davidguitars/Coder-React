## Description

### I have made this proyect for the CoderHouse React js course, it's about an Ecommerce where the main product are high quality speakers.

### The project uses the best practices for software development, using hooks and database to give a more real and professional experience.

#

## Setup

### This project was made using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) because it's one of the best tools to build a react application, uses jsx as the main files extension and is faster than other tools.

### Use the following scripts to clone the repo, download the node modules and run the app:



Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

run project:

```
npm run dev
```

## Technologies and libraries

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
  I chose this way to create my React app because it's faster than create react app
- [Sweet Alert](https://sweetalert2.github.io/)
  I used this to have a better interaction with the user, giving him a better experience with custom and pretty alert messages
- [React moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-moment)
  I used this to get the today date and include into the order object/document
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
  I used firestore and storage in Firebase to store my data, and simulate a real request to the database, this also helped me because this is a frontend application and without the backend, a good option to connect front end (client side) directly to the database is using Firebase. And it's free!
  It also allow me deploy this app with their hosting service, which is really faster and easy to use.
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)
  I used bootstrap to use their basic features, like font and box modeling and few more features.

#

## Styling

### I decided to style my app using just css, because it's a good way to practice the language and improve my knowledge in web styling.
